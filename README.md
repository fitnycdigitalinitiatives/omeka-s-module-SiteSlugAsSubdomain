SiteSlugAsSubdomain (module for Omeka S)
=======================================

[SiteSlugAsSubdomain] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows users to map the Omeka S
sites slugs as subdomains.

For example, if your Omeka S domain is [www.myapp.com](http://www.myapp.com "www.myapp.com") and your sites URLs are :
[www.myapp.com/s/my-first-site](www.myapp.com/s/my-first-site "www.myapp.com/s/my-first-site") and [www.myapp.com/s/my-second-site](www.myapp.com/s/my-second-site "www.myapp.com/s/my-second-site"),
they will become [my-first-site.myapp.com](my-first-site.myapp.com "my-first-site.myapp.com") and [my-second-site.myapp.com](my-second-site.myapp.com "my-second-site.myapp.com").


Installation
------------

Uncompress the zip inside the folder `modules` and rename it `SiteSlugAsSubdomain`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].

Requirements
------------

- The hosts must be configured on your webserver ([my-first-site.myapp.com](my-first-site.myapp.com "my-first-site.myapp.com") and ([my-second-site.myapp.com](my-second-site.myapp.com "my-first-site.myapp.com")  must answer the ping).
- Your sites must be defined as public.
- Your must set your hostname in the module configuration (see below).

Config
------

You must provide your hostname in the module configuration, otherwise the subdomain mapping will not run.

You must provide your hostname **without subdomain**, here are some examples :

http://www.example.com => example.com
http://www.example.com/ => example.com
http://www.test.example.com => test.example.com
http://www.example.co.uk => example.co.uk
http://localhost => locahost

Once installed, the Omeka S admin dashboard remains accessible at its original address.

The changes are visible in the "Sites" section of the Omeka S dashboard.

##### Notes

- Your hostname can't be an IP address (you can install Omeka S on http://192.168.1.12 but you can't have http://my-first-site.192.168.1.12).
- The module isn't compatible with the subdirectories installations (webserver aliases) at this time, for example http://www.yourapp.com/omeka-s/
- Ensure to enter your hostname in the module config withtout the potential subdomain (i.e. **www.**)


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
